// BEST: 15 bytes, size exact (0x128). Residual = uniform r6<->r7 swap: target keeps the
// loop counter in r7 and the per-half value (total / active.records base) in r6; mine is
// reversed in both halves. Ruled out: colorsweep x3 (converged), 14 pragmas, i decl/assign
// placement (entry/per-half/before-after the count store), total as int, ptr-add operand
// order, hoisted src/dst bases, separate counters per half, condition flips.
// #pragma opt_propagation off + "int mode = 1;" INSIDE each loop body is what fixed the
// missing second "mov r5,#1" (was 4 bytes SHORT without it).
//
// 08-20, opus, 18 further variants (batches in vtry form). MECHANISM FOUND, NOT YET CLOSED.
// The callee-saved band ROTATES WITH THE NUMBER OF CALL-SURVIVING VALUES, one register per
// value. Measured twice, independently: hoisting a destination base (`hoist_dst`, one half)
// and hoisting both bases (`add_survivor_both`) each moved the counter r6 -> r5 (22 and 23
// bytes). Removing a value that does NOT survive the call does nothing: `drop_n` and
// `drop_mode` left the counter in r6. So reaching r7 needs ONE FEWER genuine survivor --
// that direction is inferred from the rotation, never achieved here, because every
// size-neutral way to drop a survivor is now disproven:
//   - definition order, all 4 permutations of {counter, invariant, count-store}: 35 bytes
//   - counter as unsigned int: 16 bytes; as unsigned char: 0x130, too long
//   - invariant as int AND defined first: 35 bytes
//   - invariant left in the condition so it never becomes live (`no_invariant`): 143 bytes
//   - struct assignment instead of memcpy, both halves: 0x130 (+8). memcpy IS correct.
//   - struct assignment + no null test: 0x12c (+4)
//   - dropping the redundant-looking `rec != NULL`, both halves: 0x124, four bytes SHORT.
//     The null test is genuinely in the target -- keep it.
//   - pointer induction instead of an index: 90 bytes
// Note for whoever picks this up: batches 1 and 2 edited only the FIRST loop while the
// residual spans both (9 runs), so those numbers understate what a symmetric change does.
// The remaining idea is to remove a survivor without changing code size -- the 0x40 memcpy
// size pinned in fp is the best candidate and struct-copy was the wrong way to attack it.
